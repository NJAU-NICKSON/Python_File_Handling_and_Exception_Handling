# Python File Handling Labs

This repository contains small Python projects designed to practice file input/output (I/O) and error handling.  
It includes exercises that demonstrate how to read, write, and modify files, as well as how to handle common errors like missing or unreadable files.

---

## Projects

### 1. File Read & Write Challenge
- Reads the contents of a file.
- Applies a modification (for example, converting text to uppercase).
- Writes the modified version to a new file.

**Run it:**
```bash
python file_read_write.py
````

---

### 2. Error Handling Lab

* Asks the user to input a filename.
* Attempts to open and read the file.
* Handles errors such as:

  * File not found
  * Permission issues
  * Other unexpected errors

**Run it:**

```bash
python error_handling.py
```

---

## Features

* Practical examples of Python file I/O
* Demonstrates try-except for error handling
* Beginner-friendly structure
* Ready to extend with more mini-projects
